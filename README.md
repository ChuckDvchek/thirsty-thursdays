Welcome friends.

<!-- reason the site is needed-->
**PROJECT PURPOSE:** 
<br/>
This project is the collaborative work of a group of new developers trying to help solve a real-world problem. 
               Lack of YOU time
Time that "Matters to YOU ". Time with friends, family, complete strangers...
People often limit "their personel" time to weekends.  Its a mind set hard pressed to change. Here at Thirsty-Thursday's we DON'T believe in going against the grain. We simply ENHANCED the playing field. We want to "extend" that "personel time" to include one more day.
<br/>
Thursdays.
<br/>
Thirsty-Thursday's.-
Designed to help you create a fun night. Explore your kitchen. Find an ingredient. Put it in the search bar and click on any picture that pops up. Then click on the recipe to see if its something you would like to try. Do this with liquor or food items. All around, its a great way to extend your "YOU time".

<!--functions of the site -->
**FUNCTIONALITY:** 
<br/>
We have procured the muscle of two API'S to the site to let them do the heavy lifting. API'S sit between an application and the web server, acting as an intermediary layer that processes data transfer between systems.


We have adjusted the viewing portal to accomadate multiple screen sizes.

We created two card classes:
CockTails
Meal ideas

You can place the ingredients you want to use into the search box under the appriopriate Icon and get a recipe for a mouth-watering meal and a tasty drink.

The User Interface is easy to follow and works flawlessly.
